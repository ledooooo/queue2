Clinic Queue System - Scaffold
====================================
This ZIP contains scaffold files for the clinic queue project:
- admin.html, control.html, display.html (basic templates)
- assets/audio placeholders (mp3 files are placeholders; replace with real mp3s)
- js/ audioBuilder.js, audioQueue.js, firebase-config.js (placeholders)
- css/ tailwind via CDN (no local CSS)

IMPORTANT:
- Audio files inside assets/audio are empty placeholders. Replace them with real mp3 files named exactly as the placeholders (e.g., numbers/1.mp3, base/and.mp3).
- Update js/firebase-config.js with your Firebase config.
- Upload the assets to GitHub Pages (or /audio/ path) and set settings.mediaBaseUrl accordingly in Firebase.
